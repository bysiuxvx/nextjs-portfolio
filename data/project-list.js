    while reusing some concepts of the previous one.
    First and foremost, I decided to build it in Next.js this time around, since I really got to like this framework recently. 
    Secondly, I decided to use a UI library instead of writing literally all the styling and media queries on my own as with the first one.
    This is a huge improvement already compared to the previous one, and the experience is much smoother.
    Also Chakra UI allowed me to effortlelsy use and switch between themes.`,
