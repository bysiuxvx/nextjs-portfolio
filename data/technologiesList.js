    comment: `It was a bit frustrating to use in the beginning due to all the errors and interface setups, but that's actually the point ot if. And I noticed - I don't repeat those mistakes too often afterwards ü§ì. The key lies in knowing when and where to use it. Using TS for a landing page that has no logic behind it is a complete overkill imho.`,

    comment: `I love React, most of the things I do are in React. And this is basically React, but better. I like how some things have been improved and even simplified, like f.e the routing. SSR is also going to become a standard soon, which is the main point of this framework.`,
