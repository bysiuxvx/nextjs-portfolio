# **Next.js portfolio**

<hr>

## Description

I wanted to update my previous portfolio I made around May 2021, but instead I
chose to build a new one from scratch,

while reusing some concepts of the previous one.

First and foremost, I decided to build it in Next.js this time around, since I
really got to like this framework recently.

Secondly, I decided to use a UI library instead of writing literally all the
styling and media queries on my own as with the first one.

This is a huge improvement already compared to the previous one, and the
experience is much smoother.

Also, Chakra UI allowed me to effortlelsy use and switch between themes.
