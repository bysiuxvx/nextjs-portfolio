# **Next.js portfolio** `under construction ðŸ› `

The portfolio is almost done, only a few minor tweaks and improvements are required.
I am going to implement a nodemailer to handle the contact form next.

## Description

I wanted to update my previous portfolio I made around May 2021, but instead I chose to build a new one from scratch,
while reusing some concepts of the previous one.
First and foremost, I decided to build it in Next.js this time around, since I really got to like this framework recently.
Secondly, I decided to use a UI library instead of writing literally all the styling and media queries on my own as with the first one.
This is a huge improvement already compared to the previous one, and the experience is much smoother.
Also Chakra UI allowed me to effortlelsy use and switch between themes.
