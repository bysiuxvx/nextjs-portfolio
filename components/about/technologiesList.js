      "Coming from React, it was a bit confusing to use in the beginning when I landed my first junior position in a company using Agular in all of the projects. It took me some time to get used to it, but nowadays I really enjoy it. What I appreciate the most about Angualr is that it comes as a whole package that just works. You don't need to contemplate for hours what library to use for forms, what state management to go for. It's that simple. I love RXJS and the fact that Signals are now a part of Angular too.",

I like how some things have been improved and even simplified, like the routing as an example. SSR is also going to become a standard soon if not already, which is the main point of this framework.`,
